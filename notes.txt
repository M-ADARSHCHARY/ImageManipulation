ðŸ”¹ Project Name: *Image Manipulation with NumPy & Matplotlib*

* Load an image as a NumPy array.
* Do basic operations: crop, resize, flip horizontally/vertically, change brightness.
* Plot original vs modified images with Matplotlib.

ðŸ‘‰ Skills Lean: Image = array concept, slicing, broadcasting.


**********************
Images become 3D arrays: (height, width, channels)
    - Channels = 3 for RGB (Red, Green, Blue)

CROP:

Crop image using array slicing
    
    Explanation:
    - Array slicing: img[row_start:row_end, col_start:col_end]
    - top:bottom = rows to keep (vertical crop)
    - left:right = columns to keep (horizontal crop)


tight_layout() :
It adusts :
Padding between subplots
Margins around the figure
Title spacing to prevent cut-off
Overall spacing for readability
